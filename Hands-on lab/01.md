8. Enter the following credentials (or the non-default credentials if you changed them):

    - **Username:** demouser
    - **Password:** Password.1!!

    ![The credentials above are entered in the Login to xrdp dialog box.](media/login-to-xrdp.png "Login to xrdp dialog box")

9. Select **OK** to log into the Lab VM.

### Task 2: Grant permissions to Docker

In this task, you will grant permissions to the demouser account to access the Unix socket needed to communicate with the Docker engine.

1. On your Lab VM, open a **Bash** shell by selecting the Start menu, and then expanding Debian, Applications, and Shells.

    ![In the Lab VM start menu, Debian -> Applications -> Shells is expanded, and Bash is highlighted in the Shells menu.](media/labvm-menu-bash-shell.png "Start menu")

2. At the command prompt, enter the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
    ```

3. After running the command, you will need **completely log out of the Lab VM** and log back in (if in doubt, reboot).

4. After logging back in, run the following command to test that the demouser account has proper permissions:

    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```

    ![Screenshot of the bash shell command sudo usermod -a pG docker \$USER output. Includes output from running the test command, docker run hello-world.](media/bash-docker-hello-world.png "Bash Shell")

### Task 3: Integrate GitHub into VS Code

In this task, you will install the GitHub extension in VS Code, and configure a service integration with your GitHub account. This integration will allow you to push your code changes to GitHub directly from VS Code.

1. On your Lab VM, open **VS Code** under Programming on the Start menu.

    ![Visual Studio Code is highlighted under Programming on the start menu.](media/labvm-menu-programming-vscode.png "Visual Studio Code")

2. In VS Code, select the **Extensions** icon from the left-hand menu, enter "github" into the **Extensions** search box, and select the **GitHub** extension.

    ![Extensions is highlighted in the Visual Studio Code navigation pane, github is entered in the Extensions search box, and GitHub is highlighted below.](media/vscode-extensions-github.png "Visual Studio Code navigation pane")

3. Select **Install** in the Extension: GitHub window.

18. Close VS Code.

### Task 4: Clone the starter application

In this task, you will clone the starter application, creating a local copy on your Lab VM.

1. On your Lab VM, open a browser, and navigate to your GitHub account **https://<span></span>github.com**.

2. Within your GitHub account, navigate to the forked copy of the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-Devops` application page, select **Clone or download**, then select the **copy** link next to the web URL.

    ![The Clone or download button is selected on the forked copy of the MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-Devops application page, and the web URL is displayed below it.](media/github-clone.png "Select Clone or download")

3. Open a new bash shell, and enter the following command:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    ```

4. Next, enter the following command, replacing `[EMAIL]` with the email address you used when creating your GitHub account. This will associate your git email address with the commits made from the Lab VM.

    ```bash
    git config --global user.email "[EMAIL]"
    ```

    ![The above command to associate your git email address with the commits made from the Lab VM is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/bash-git-config.png "bash terminal window")

5. At the prompt, enter the following command, replacing `[CLONE-URL]` with URL you copied from GitHub in step 2 above:

    ```bash
    git clone [CLONE-URL]
    ```

    ![The git clone command is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/bash-git-clone.png "bash terminal window")

6. Now, change the directory to the cloned project by entering the following at the prompt:

    ```bash
    cd MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps
    ```

    ![The command to change the directory is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/bash-cd-mcw-oss-paas-and-devops.png "bash terminal window")

7. Finally, issue a command to open the starter project in VS Code by typing:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

8. A new VS Code window will open, with the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` folder opened.

    ![The MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-Devops folder is open in the Explorer pane in the Visual Studio Code window, and the Welcome pane is open on the right.](media/vscode-mcw-oss-paas-and-devops.png "Visual Studio Code window")

9. You are now ready to begin working with the project in VS Code.

### Task 5: Launch the starter application

In this task, you will seed the MongoDB with sample data, then run the application locally, connected to your MongoDB instance. This task is to verify the connection to MongoDB and that it contains the seeded plan data, before we migrate the application and data to Azure Cosmos DB.

1. Return to VS Code, select **Terminal** from the menu, and select **New Terminal**.

    ![New Terminal is highlighted in the Terminal menu in Visual Studio Code.](media/vscode-terminal-menu.png "Visual Studio Code Terminal menu")

2. This will open a new bash terminal window at the bottom of the VS Code dialog.

3. Change directories to the `Hands-on lab/lab-files` folder by running the following command. **Important**: Be sure to include the quotes around the path, since it contains a space.

    ```bash
    cd "Hands-on lab/lab-files"
    ```

4. At the bash prompt, use the `npm install` command to ensure the required components are installed on your Lab VM.

    ```bash
    sudo npm install
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the terminal window at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code dialog box. The command above is entered at the command prompt, and the results of the command are displayed.](media/vscode-terminal-npm-install.png "Bash terminal window")

5. Next, enter the following to seed the local MongoDB database with plans, user accounts, and orders.

    ```bash
    node data/Seed.js
    ```

    ![The above command to seed the local MongoDB database is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/vscode-terminal-seedjs.png "Bash terminal window")

    >**Note**: If you receive an error that the service is not running, start the MongoDB service by executing the `sudo service mongod start` command at the shell prompt.

6. Next, build the application using the following:

    ```bash
    sudo npm run build
    ```

7. Finally, enter the following to start the web server for the application. You will see a `connection successful` message in the terminal window.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

8. Open a browser and navigate to **http://<span></span>localhost:3000** to view the landing page of the starter application. You will see three plans listed on the application home page, which are pulled from the local MongoDB database.

    ![Two Person Plan, Four Person Plan, and High-Pro Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the application home page.](media/bfyo-web-home.png "View the three plans")

9. Return to the VS Code integrated terminal window, and press **CTRL+C** to stop the application.

 Now, click on the **Next** from lower right corner of your lab guide page to execute the next exercise.
