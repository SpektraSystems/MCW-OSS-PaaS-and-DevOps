## Exercise 3: Containerize the app

Duration: 30 minutes

This exercise walks you through containerizing the existing Best For You Organics Company MERN application using Docker, pushing the image to an **Azure Container Registry**, then deploying the image to **Web App for Containers** directly from VS Code.

### Task 1: Install Docker extension in VS Code

The Docker extension for VS Code is used to simplify the management of local Docker images and commands, as well as the deployment of a built app image to Azure.

1. On your Lab VM, return to VS Code and the open `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` starter project.

2. Select the **Extensions icon** from the left-hand menu, enter "docker" into the search box, select the **Docker** extension, and in the **Extension: Docker** window, and then select **Install**.

    ![Extensions is highlighted in the Visual Studio Code navigation pane, docker is entered in the Extensions search box, Docker is highlighted below, and Install is highlighted on the right.](media/vscode-extensions-docker.png "Visual Studio Code window")

3. You should now see a Docker icon appear in the left-hand menu of Visual Studio Code. Select the **Docker** icon. Expand **Registries** and then expand **Azure**. If you do not see Azure listed, select **Connect registry** and select **Azure** from the list of registries. You should see the **bestforyouregistry** you created above listed.

    ![In the Docker VS Code extension, Registries and Azure are expanded, and the bestforyouregistry is highlighted.](media/vscode-extension-docker-registries.png "Docker extension")

    > **Note**: If you don't see the Docker icon in the left-hand menu, close and reopen VS Code, and the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` project.

### Task 2: Create Docker image and run the app

In this task, you will use VS Code, and the Docker extension, to add the necessary files to the project to create a custom Docker image for the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` app.

1. On your Lab VM, return to VS Code, and the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` project.

2. Open the VS Code Command Palette, by selecting **View** from the menu, then **Command Palette**.

3. Enter "add docker" into the Command Palette and select **Docker: Add docker files to workspace**.

    ![Docker: Add docker files to workspace is selected under add docker in the Command Palette.](media/vscode-command-palette-add-docker.png "Select Docker: Add docker files to workspace")

4. At the **Select Application Platform** prompt, select **Node.js**.

    ![Node.js is highlighted at the Select Application Platform prompt.](media/vscode-command-palette-app-platform.png "Select Node.js")

5. Ensure port "3000" is entered on the next screen, and press **Enter**.

    ![3000 is selected in the field above What port does your app listen on?](media/vscode-command-palette-docker-port.png "Explorer")

6. This will add Dockerfile, along with several configuration files for Docker compose to the project.

    ![Dockerfile and several configuration files are highlighted in the Explorer pane.](media/vscode-docker-files.png "Explorer pane")

7. Select **Dockerfile** from the file navigator and observe the contents. This file provides the commands required to assemble a Docker image for the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` application.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Dockerfile contents. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the window. Future versions of this course should address this.](media/vscode-docker-file.png "Dockerfile screenshot")

8. Currently, the Docker extension for Visual Studio Code places the generated Docker files in the root directory of the project. Because the project files are all located in the `lab-files` directory, we need to move the generated files into that folder. Select the `.dockerignore`, `docker-compose.debug.yml`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `Dockerfile` files, and then drag and drop them into the `Hands-on lab/lab-files` folder. Respond Yes if prompted about moving the files.

    ![The docker files specified above are highlighted within the Hands-on lab/lab-files folder.](media/vscode-docker-move-files.png "Visual Studio Code files")

9. Next, you will tell Docker to build and image for your app. Select the **Terminal** menu in Visual Studio Code, and then select **New Terminal**.

    ![New Terminal is highlighted in the Terminal menu in Visual Studio Code.](media/vscode-terminal-menu.png "Visual Studio Code Terminal menu")

10. In the new terminal window, change the directory to the `Hands-on lab/lab-files` folder by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    cd "Hands-on lab/lab-files"
    ```

11. With the next command you will provide a **registry**, **image name**, and **tag**, using the following format. This format will allow the image to be pushed to your container registry.

    > `[registry]/[image name]:[tag]`

12. For this, you will need the Login server value from your Azure Container registry's **Access keys** blade.

    ![Access keys is selected under Settings on the Azure Container registry's Access keys blade, and on the right, bestforyouregistry.azurecr.io is highlighted in the Login server box on the right.](media/acr-login-server.png "Container registry blade")

13. At the terminal prompt, enter the following, where `[Login server]` is the Login server value from Azure:

    ```bash
    docker build --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t [Login server]/best-for-you-organics:latest .
    ```

    > **Note**: Be sure to include the "." at the end of the line.

14. For example:

    ```bash
    docker build --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t bestforyouregistry.azurecr.io/best-for-you-organics:latest .
    ```

15. Press **Enter**, which will trigger the build of the image. You will see the following output in the terminal window:

    ![The docker build command above is entered into the VS Code terminal window.](media/vscode-terminal-docker-build.png "Docker build")

16. Once the build completes, select the **Docker** icon in the left-hand menu of Visual Studio Code and then expand **Images**. You will see the `best-for-you-organics` image.

    ![The image is highlighted in the DOCKER extension explorer under Images.](media/vscode-extensions-docker-images.png "Docker extension explorer")

17. You can also use the `docker images` command in the Integrated terminal to list the images.

    ![The docker images command is entered in the terminal window, with the list of images is displayed.](media/vscode-terminal-docker-images.png "Docker images")

### Task 3: Run the containerized app

In this task, you run the app from the container you built in the previous task.

1. In the **Images** area of the Docker extension in VS Code, expand the `best-for-you-organics` image, and then right-click on the `latest` image, and select **Run Interactive**.

    ![The image is selected in the Images area of the Docker extension explorer, and Run Interactive is highlighted in the shortcut menu.](media/vscode-extensions-docker-images-latest.png "Docker extension explorer")

    > **Note**: If you receive an error that the address is already in use, return to the terminal window where you ran the application using the `npm start` command and press `CTRL+C` to stop the application. Then, try the above action again.

2. Notice in the Interactive terminal that a docker run command is issued. Using the VS Code Docker extension, you can issue some docker commands, without needing to work from the command line.

    ![The docker run command is highlighted in the Interactive terminal window.](media/vscode-terminal-docker-run.png "Interactive terminal window")

3. Verify the web app and container are functioning by opening a browser window and navigating to **(http://<span></span>localhost:3000)**.

    ![Two Person Plan, Four Person Plan, and High-Pro Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the web app, and localhost:3000/ is highlighted.](media/bfyo-web-home.png "View the web app")

4. In the Integrated terminal of VS Code, for the interactive session, press **CTRL+C** to stop the container.

### Task 4: Push image to Azure Container Registry

In this task, you are going to push the image to your Azure Container Registry.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group, and select the **bestforyouregistrySUFFIX** Container registry from the list of resources.

    ![The bestforyouregistry Container registry is highlighted in the list of resources on the Azure portal.](media/azure-rg-bestforyouregistry.png "List of resources")

2. On the **bestforyouregistrySUFFIX** blade, select **Access keys** under settings in the left-hand menu, and leave this page up as you will be referencing the **Login server**, **Username**, and **password** in the next task.

    ![Access keys is selected under Settings on the Azure Container registry's Access keys blade, and the values in the Login server, Username, and Name boxes are highlighted on the right.](media/acr-access-keys.png "Container Registry blade")

3. Return to the Integrated terminal window in VS Code and enter the following command to log in to your Azure Container registry, replacing the bracketed values with those from the container registry access keys page.

    ```bash
    docker login [Login Server] -u [Username]
    ```

4. For example:

    ```bash
    docker login bestforyouregistry.azurecr.io -u bestforyouregistry
    ```

5. Copy and paste the Container registry password when prompted to complete the login process.

    ![This is a screenshot of the password prompt in the Visual Studio Code Integrated terminal window.](media/vscode-terminal-docker-login.png "Integrated terminal window")

6. Once you are successfully logged in, expand the bestforyouregistry image in the Docker extension section of the VS Code, right-click on the latest image, and select **Push**.

    ![The image is selected in the Images area of the Docker extension explorer, and Push is highlighted in the shortcut menu.](media/vscode-docker-push.png "Docker extension explorer")

7. If prompted to set the default registry path, select **Yes**.

    ![Yes is highlighted on the dialog to set the default registry path.](media/vscode-extensions-docker-push.png "Set default registry path")

8. Note the "docker push" command issued in the terminal window.

    ![This is a screenshot of the docker push command in the Visual Studio Code Integrated terminal window.](media/vscode-terminal-docker-push.png "Integrated terminal window")

9. To verify the push, return to the **bestforyouregistry** Registry container blade in the Azure portal, and select **Repositories** under **Services** on the left-hand side, and note the **best-for-you-organics** repository.

    ![In your Azure Container Registry's repository, Repositories is selected and highlighted under Services, and best-for-you-organics is highlighted under Repositories.](media/acr-repositories.png "Container registry blade")
    
Now, click on the **Next** from lower right corner of your lab guide page to execute the next exercise.
