## Exercise 6: Create Azure Functions for order processing

Duration: 45 minutes

In this task, you create the Azure Functions that will handle order processing. The first function will send unprocessed order details into a storage queue. This Function uses a timer trigger and checks the processed field on order documents, ensuring only unprocessed orders are sent to the processing queue. A second function is used to simulate order processing and send notifications to the user who placed the order.

### Task 1: Configure storage queues

In this task, you add two storage queues to the storage account provisioned when you created your Function App. These queues are used to store orders and notifications that need to be processed.

1. In the **Azure portal**, select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list and then select the **hands-on-lab-func-SUFFIX** resource group.

    ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. Select the **bestforyouordersSUFFIX** storage account that was created when you provisioned your Function App.

3. Select **Queues** from the **Services** area of the **Overview** blade.

    ![Queues is highlighted in the Services area of the Overview blade.](media/storage-account-queues.png "Overview blade Services area")

4. On the **Queue service** blade, select **+Queue** to add a new queue.

    ![+ Queue is highlighted on the Queue service blade.](media/storage-account-queue-add.png "Queue service blade")

5. In the **Add** queue dialog, enter **orderqueue** for the **Queue name**, and select **OK**.

    ![The name "orderqueue" is entered in the Queue name box in the Add queue dialog box.](media/storage-order-queue.png "Add queue dialog box")

6. Select **+Queue** again, and this time enter "notificationqueue" for the **Queue name**.

    ![The name "notificationqueue" is entered in the Queue name box in the Add queue dialog box.](media/storage-notification-queue.png "Add queue dialog box")

### Task 2: Create timer triggered function

In this task, you will create a function that function sends all new orders to a queue for processing and shipping. The function uses a Timer trigger and an output binding to an Azure Storage Queue.

1. In the **Azure portal**, navigate to your Function App by selecting it from the list of resources in the **hands-on-lab-func-SUFFIX** resource group.

2. From the left-hand menu on your **Function Apps** blade, select **Functions**, then select **+New function**.

    ![Functions is selected and highlighted in the left-hand menu on the Function Apps blade, and + New function is highlighted on the right.](media/function-app-new.png "Function Apps blade")

3. In the trigger search box, select the **Timer trigger**.

    ![The Timer trigger box is displayed.](media/function-timer-trigger.png "Timer trigger")

4. In the **Timer trigger** dialog, enter the following:

    - **Name**: Enter "OrdersTimerTrigger".
    - **Schedule**: Leave the default value, `0 */5 * * * *`. This will execute the trigger every 5 minutes.
    - Select **Create**.

    ![The information above is entered in the Timer trigger blade.](media/function-app-new-function.png "Timer trigger blade")

5. After the function is created, select **Integrate** under the new function.

6. Next, select **+New Output**, select **Azure Queue Storage**, and choose **Select**.

    ![+ New Output is highlighted under Outputs, Azure Queue Storage is selected below it, and Select is selected at the bottom.](media/function-app-new-output.png "Select Azure Queue Storage")

7. Install extensions, if prompted to do so.

    ![Extensions not installed warning.](media/function-app-install-extensions.png "Install")

8. For the **Azure Queue Storage output**, enter the following:

    - **Message parameter name**: outputQueue
    - **Queue name:** orderqueue (all lowercase, as casing matters)
    - **Storage account collection:** Select **AzureWebJobsStorage** from the list (this is the bestforyouordersSUFFIX storage account you created when you provisioned your Function App).
    - Select **Save**.

    ![The information above is entered in the Azure Queue Storage output dialog box, and Save is selected at the bottom.](media/function-app-storage-queue-output.png "Azure Queue Storage output page")

9. Now, select the **bestforyouorders** Function App in the left-hand menu, and then select the **Platform features** tab. On the Platform features tab, select **Advanced tools (Kudu)** under Development tools.

    ![The bestforyouorders Function App is selected and highlighted in the left-hand menu, the Platform features tab is selected, and the Advanced tools (Kudu) link is highlighted under Development tools.](media/function-app-platform-features-kudu.png "Platform features tab")

10. In the new browser window that opens, select **Debug console -> PowerShell** from the top menu.

    ![The Kudu window is displayed with Debug console, PowerShell highlighted in the menu.](media/kudu-debug-console.png "Kudu")

    ```json
    {
        "name": "best-for-you-organics",
        "dependencies": {
            "mongodb": "3.x"
        }
    }
    ```

    ![The JSON above is entered into the file editor screen, and the Save button is highlighted.](media/kudu-file-editor.png "File editor")

16. In the Kudu Remote Execution Console, run the following at the command prompt:

    ```powershell
    npm install
    ```

    ![At the Kudu PowerShell prompt, the command above is entered, and the output of the command is displayed.](media/kudu-powershell.png "PowerShell")

    > **Note**: The addition of the `mongodb` dependency is necessary because the Cosmos DB MongoDB API cannot be used to bind a Function App to Cosmos DB. Only the SQL API is currently compatible with Function App triggers.

17. Return to your Function App blade in the Azure portal and select the **OrdersTimerTrigger** function in the left-hand menu.

    ![The OrdersTimerTrigger function is selected in the left-hand menu.](media/function-app-orders-timer-trigger.png "Left menu")

18. To get the code for the `OrdersTimerTrigger` function, go into the project is VS Code, expand the `Hands-on lab/lab-files/AzureFunctions` folder, and open the `OrdersTimerTrigger.js` file.

19. Replace the `uri` variable value on line 4 of the `OrdersTriggerTimer.js` file with the primary connection string for your Cosmos DB, which you can retrieve from the Connection String blade of your Azure Cosmos DB account.

    ![The Azure Cosmos DB account connection string blade is displayed, and the primary connection string is highlighted.](media/cosmos-db-connection-string.png "Connection string")

20. Copy all of the code within the file.

21. Return to your `OrdersTimerTrigger` function in the Azure portal and paste the code into the `index.js` block, overwriting all the existing code. Your `index.js` file should now look like the following:

    ![This is a screenshot of the index.js block.](media/function-app-index-js.png "Index.js block")

22. Next, select **Save and run** above the code block to trigger the function and observe it running in the Logs block.

    ![Logs is highlighted below the code block.](media/function-app-logs.png "Select Logs")

23. Return to the starter application in your browser window, and select **Sign In**.

    ![Two Person Plan, High-Pro Plan, and Four Person Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the starter application, and Sign In is highlighted at the top.](media/bfyo-web-sign-in.png "Sign in to the starter application")

24. On the Login screen, enter the following credentials, and select **Login**:

    - **Email address:** demouser@bfyo.<span></span>com
    - **Password:** Password.1!!

    ![The credentials above are entered in the Login page.](media/bfyo-web-login-page.png "Login page")

25. After logging in, you will be returned to the home page. Choose **Select this plan** for any of the plans.

    ![Two Person Plan, High-Pro Plan, and Four Person Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the home page, and all three boxes' Select this plan buttons are highlighted.](media/bfyo-web-plans.png "Select a plan")

26. On the **Place Order** screen, select **Place Order**. This will create a new order in the Cosmos DB `orders` collection. Within 5 minutes the Timer trigger of your function will fire, and then send the order on to the `orderqueue` for processing.

    ![The Place Order button is highlighted at the bottom of the Place Order page.](media/bfyo-place-order.png "Place your order page")

27. Finally, verify items are being written to the order queue, by going to the queue in the Azure Storage account, and observing that items have been added to the `orderqueue`.

    ![The Refresh button is highlighted in the Azure Storage account, and Message Text appears in the order queue below.](media/storage-queue-items.png "Messages blade")

### Task 3: Create Queue function

In this task, you will create a second function which will be triggered by the output of the OrdersTimerTrigger function. This will simulate the order processing and will add items to the notificationqueue if the order processing is complete and the `sendNotifications` property is true for the order.

This will use an Azure Storage Queue trigger, and an input dataset from Cosmos DB, pulling in customers. Output dataset will be Azure Cosmos DB orders table, and an update to set `processed = true`, and the `processedDate` to today.

1. Select **Integrate** under the OrdersTimerTrigger function, then select **Azure Queue Storage (outputQueue)** under **Outputs**.

    ![Azure Queue Storage (outputQueue) is selected and highlighted under Outputs in the OrdersTimerTrigger function.](media/function-app-output-storage-queue.png "Outputs section")

2. Under **Actions** for the output, select **Go** next to **Create a new function triggered by this output**.

    ![The Go button is next to Create a new function triggered by this output under Actions.](media/function-app-actions-go.png "Actions section")

3. Select **Azure Queue Storage trigger** from the list.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Queue trigger box.](media/azure-queue-storage-trigger.png "Queue trigger box")

4. On the **Queue trigger New Function** dialog, enter the following:

    - **Name:** Enter ProcessOrders.
    - **Queue name:** orderqueue
    - **Storage account connection:** Select **AzureWebJobsStorage**.
    - Select **Create**.

    ![The information above is entered in the Queue trigger New Function dialog box.](media/process-orders-function.png "Queue trigger New Function dialog box")

5. When the function has been created, select **Integrate** under the **ProcessOrders** function, change the Message parameter name to "orderToProcess" for the **Azure Queue storage trigger**, and select **Save**.

    ![Integrate is selected and highlighted under the ProcessOrders function on the left, and orderToProcess is highlighted in the Message parameter name box on the right.](media/function-app-integrate-process-orders.png "Azure Queue Storage trigger section")

6. Now, select **+New Output**, select **Azure Queue Storage**, and choose **Select**.

    ![+ New Output is highlighted under Outputs, Azure Queue Storage is selected below it, and Select is selected at the bottom.](media/function-app-new-output-storage-queue.png "Outputs section")

7. For the **Azure Queue Storage output**, enter the following:

    - **Message parameter name**: "outputQueue"
    - **Queue name:** "notificationqueue" (all lowercase, as casing matters)
    - **Storage account collection:** Select **AzureWebJobsStorage** from the list.
    - Select **Save**.
