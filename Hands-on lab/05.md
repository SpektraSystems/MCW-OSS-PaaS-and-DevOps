    ![The committed changes are displayed on the build page.](media/jenkins-build-history-details.png "Build page")

9. You have successfully set up your CI pipeline.

### Task 6: Install Docker on the Jenkins VM

In this task, you will install Docker CE on your Jenkins VM, so it can be used to build images from the build artifacts produced by your CI build.

1. The first step is to ensure no older versions of Docker are installed on your Jenkins VM. Using the SSH tunnel bash terminal you opened previously, navigate to the command prompt, and enter:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
    ```

2. Next, you need to set up a Docker repository on the host machine. The begin, update the `apt` package index:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

3. Install the necessary packages to allow `apt` to use a repository over HTTPS, entering `y` when prompted to continue.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common
    ```

4. Add Docker's official GPG key.

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

5. Verify that you now have the key with fingerprint `9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88`, by searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
    ```

6. You should see output similar to:

    ```bash
    pub   4096R/0EBFCD88 2017-02-22
        Key fingerprint = 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
    uid                  Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com>
    sub   4096R/F273FCD8 2017-02-22
    ```

7. Next, enter the following commands to set up the **stable** repository.

    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository \
    "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) \
    stable"
    ```

8. You are now ready to install Docker CE. Start by updating the `apt` package index.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

9. Install the latest version of Docker CE, entering `y` when prompted to continue.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce
    ```

10. Verify that Docker CE is installed correctly by running the `hello-world` image.

    ```bash
    sudo docker run hello-world
    ```

    ![Hello world message from Docker on the Jenkins server.](media/bash-jenkins-docker-hello-world.png "Jenkins Docker install")

11. The final step is to add permission to the `jenkins` user to Docker.

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins
    sudo chmod 664 /run/docker.sock
    ```

12. Now, restart the Jenkins service, entering the jenkinsadmin password, `Password.1!!`, when prompted.

    ```bash
    service jenkins restart
    ```

### Task 7: Add continuous delivery to Jenkins build job

In this task, you will use the [Azure App Service Jenkins plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-app-service) to add continuous deployment (CD) to the Jenkins build pipeline. This will use a post-build action to create a new Docker image from the build, push that image to your Azure Container Registry, and deploy the image to your Web App for Containers instance. This post-build action will run under the credentials of the SP you created in the previous task.

1. In a new browser window, navigate to your Container registry in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by selecting **Resource groups** from the Azure navigation menu, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group from the list, and then selecting the **Container registry** resource.

2. On the Container registry blade, select **Access keys** from the left-hand menu and leave this page open for the following steps.

3. Return to your **Jenkins** dashboard, and select the **best-for-you-build** project.

    ![The best-for-you-build project is highlighted on the Jenkins dashboard.](media/jenkins-dashboard-best-for-you-build.png "Jenkins dashboard")

    > **Note**: You may need to login again using the username **jenkins** and password **Password.1!!**.

4. Select **Configure** from the left-hand menu.

    ![Configure is highlighted in the left-hand menu.](media/jenkins-project-configure.png "Jenkins left-hand menu")

5. On the configure screen, scroll down to the Build section and select the Execute shell block you created previously.

6. Return to the Container registry Access keys blade in the Azure portal, copy the values specified below and paste them into the appropriate values in the `docker build` command below.

    - **Login server**: Copy the Azure Container Registry's Login server value, and paste into the command below as the `ACR_URL` value.
    - **Username**: Copy the Username value for your Azure Container Registry, and paste into the command below as the `ACR_USERNAME` value.
    - **Password**: Enter the password value for your Azure Container Registry, and paste into the command below as the `ACR_PASSWORD` value.

        ![In the Container Registry Access keys blade, the Login Server, Username, and password fields are highlighted.](media/azure-container-registry-access-keys.png "Container Registry Access keys")

    ```bash
    ACR_URL="<your-container-registry-login-server>"
    ACR_USERNAME="<your-container-registry-username>"
    ACR_PASSWORD="<your-container-registry-password>"

    docker build --tag "${ACR_URL}/best-for-you-organics:latest" .
    docker login $ACR_URL --username $ACR_USERNAME --password $ACR_PASSWORD
    docker push "${ACR_URL}/best-for-you-organics:latest"
    ```

7. You final command should look similar to the following:

    ```bash
    ACR_URL="bestforyouregistrykb.azurecr.io"
    ACR_USERNAME="bestforyouregistrykb"
    ACR_PASSWORD="uddDqqTdBdxaI=QMmTqTfAg75cJHnfcj"

    docker build --tag "${ACR_URL}/best-for-you-organics:latest" .
    docker login $ACR_URL --username $ACR_USERNAME --password $ACR_PASSWORD
    docker push "${ACR_URL}/best-for-you-organics:latest"
    ```

8. Copy the completed command text and paste it below the `npm run build` line within the Execute shell Command box. The Execute shell command should now look similar to the following:

    ![The command above is appended to the execute shell command.](media/jenkins-execute-shell-command-cd.png "Execute shell")

9. Select **Save**.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Save (selected) and Apply buttons.](media/jenkins-save.png "Select Save")

### Task 8: Trigger CI-CD pipeline

In this task, you will commit changes to the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` starter application and trigger the full CI/CD pipeline through Jenkins, resulting in the updated application being added to a new Docker image, pushed to ACR, and deployed to Web App for Containers.

1. Return to VS Code on your Lab VM, open the `.dockerignore` file, and delete the line containing __DockerFile*__ from the file. This will allow Jenkins to use the file to build the container in the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

2. Next, open the `src/components/plan/Plans.js` file, and insert the following markup between `<div class="container">` and `<Grid>`:

    ```html
    <h3>Welcome to Best For You Organics Company</h3>
    ```

    ![The src/components/plan/Plans.js file is highlighted on the left side of Visual Studio Code, and the markup above is highlighted on the right.](media/vscode-plans-js.png "VS Code")

3. Save the updated files.

4. As you did in [Task 4](#task-4-trigger-ci-build), above, select the **Source Control icon** from the left-hand menu, enter a commit comment, select **+** to stage the change, and select the **checkmark** to commit the change, and push to GitHub. Enter your credentials if prompted. This will trigger the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

    ![The updated files are listed under Staged Changes in VS Code, and a commit comment is entered.](media/visual-studio-code-cd-file-updates-commit.png "Visual Studio Code")

5. Return to your Jenkins dashboard, and select the **best-for-you-build** project, and select the latest build number under Build History.

    ![The Jenkins build history is displayed, with a progress bar next to #2.](media/jenkins-build-history.png "Jenkins build history")

6. On the Build page, select **Console Output** from the left-hand menu.

    ![Console Output is highlighted in the left-hand menu on the Jenkins project build page.](media/jenkins-build-console-output.png "Build console output")

7. On the Console Output page, you can monitor the build progress. When it completes after a few minutes, you will see a SUCCESS message similar to the following:

    ![A build and Docker deployment success message is displayed in the console output in Jenkins.](media/jenkins-build-console-output-success.png "Build and Docker deployment success")

8. When the deployment is complete, you can verify the changes deployed successfully by navigating to your App Service instance in the Azure portal, and selecting the URL on the overview blade. The deployment of the container can take several minutes to complete so refreshes may take a few minutes to show the new header.

    >**Tip**: It may help to open the app in an Incognito or InPrivate browser window, as the old page may be cached.

9. You should see the home page, with a new header above the three plans on the page.

    ![Welcome to Best for You Organics Company! is highlighted above the Two Person Plan, Four Person Plan, and High-Pro Plan boxes in this screenshot of the home page.](media/bfyo-web-welcome.png "Home page")

Now, click on the **Next** from lower right corner of your lab guide page to execute the next exercise.
